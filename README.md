# ClassData
Sample datasets for data skills workshops at Griffith University. 

Amended dataset from DataCarpentry lesson OpenRefine for Social Science Data https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/setup.html
Original DataCarpentry dataset available via  https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815 which is a teaching version of the Studying African Farmer-Lead Irrigation (SAFI) database. 
The SAFI dataset represents interviews of farmers in two countries in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania). These interviews were conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 and probed household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), and assets (e.g. number and types of livestock). The data used in this lesson is a subset of the teaching version that has been intentionally ‘messed up’ for this lesson.

Further changes were made to lesson dataset including: 
District Column changed some Manica values to MAN for exercise Fixing Data in Bulk by Facet and Edit. 

GPS_Latitude Column: removed 4 values for facet by blank exercise. 
Removed the following columns to reduce issues finding columns in lesson: Province; agr_assoc; _members_count; remittance_money;years_liv; other_buildings; plots_count; window_type; parents_liv; p_parents_liv;	grand_liv;	sp_grand_liv; respondent_wall_type_other; no_group_count	yes_group_count; No_food; need_money;	money_source;	money_source_other; crops_contr; emply_lab	du_labour; du_look_aftr_cows; items_owned_other; gps_Accuracy; water_use; period_use;	exper_other; other_meth; res_change	memb_assoc; resp_assoc; fees_water; affect_conflicts; Liv_other.
